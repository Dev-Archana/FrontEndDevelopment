/* 
CSS combinators define the relationship between two selectors.
 CSS selectors are patterns used to select elements for styling. 
 A CSS selector can be simple or complex, consisting of more than 
 one selector connected using combinators. Understanding these combinators 
 is essential for precise and efficient styling in CSS.
